# fastunit

Async unittest of Python3. Run every testcases with corotine. 

## Usage

Download/Git clone source code, and run `./install.sh` (or `python setup.py install`) to install.

To use fasttest instead of unittest simply replace `import unittest` with `import fastunit`.

I also upload the `HTMLTestRunner.py`, with some changes to make it work well with fastunit.
